The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is totes different. We were finally allowed to redesign the company site at LeadFlash. Like most corporate site redesigns there were a lot of opinions flying around the board room. The end result was a compromise of executive taste,departmental needs and design aesthetics that I am pretty happy with. We now have an up-to-date, responsive site that is representative of our standing in the industry. The before and after say it all.
